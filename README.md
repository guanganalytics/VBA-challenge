# VBA-challenge
For this assignment, I am trying to summerize stock increases/decreases situation for 2018 from tremendous raw data output.
The first step was to clean the stock raw data: result is to a summerize a table with each ticker per line with calculated % changes(positive or negative) in a year and its total volume.
Next, using VBA script, I output three tickers that have the greated increase, greatest decrease and the greatest trading value.
Expanding the scope of the analysis, I also applied the same analysis to 2019 and 2020 stock data.
